# AutonomyGame
Autonomy is a game that was originally written some years ago as a freshman in university. This code is the result of decompilation of the game's executable. The code is largely as it was when it was originally written and due to the fantastic work done by the Monogame community, it still compiles and runs now. The requires the artwork which is found in the content folder, they must be packaged by the [Monogame Content Manager](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tools/mgcb.html) in order to work.

The development enviroment can easily be set up on Linux using [this wonderful guide from Ladesoft](https://www.ladesoft.com/pages/notes/monogame_command_line.html). Once the content is build and the environment is set up it should be buildable and executable, but not bug free.

The code works, but it lacks comments, decompilation does not save them, a well thought out design, any attempt at optimization. In short, it is quite ugly, nobody has seen it since I wrote it in 2013.  

I am just happy that such a formative and large project of mine was not entirely lost to the sands of time, yet.
