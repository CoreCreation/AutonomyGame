# AutonomyGame
Autonomy is a game that was originally written some years ago as a freshman in university. This code is the result of decompilation of the game's executable. The code is largely as it was when it was originally written and due to the fantastic work done by the Monogame community, it still compiles and runs now. 

In order to run it requires the artwork, which is found in the content folder, to be packaged by the [Monogame Content Manager](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tools/mgcb.html).

The development environment can easily be set up on Linux using [this wonderful guide from Ladesoft](https://www.ladesoft.com/pages/notes/monogame_command_line.html). Once the content is built and the environment is set up it should be buildable and executable, but not bug-free.

The code, in short, is quite ugly. Nobody has seen it since I wrote it in 2013. It was a progression of getting things to work and then leaving them for refactoring later, which never happened. There are spelling errors, design pattern breaking globals, patchwork physics, etc. It is not great code, but I am just happy that such a formative and large project of mine was not entirely lost to the sands of time, yet. For its pros, it features a sprite animation system, a level editor, a custom GUI, and many other small things.
